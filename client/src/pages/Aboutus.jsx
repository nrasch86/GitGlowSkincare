Welcome to GitGlow, where innovation meets skincare expertise! Founded by a group of passionate programming students, 
we are on a mission to revolutionize skincare for fellow coders. Fueled by our love for technology and a desire to tackle 
the effects of blue light, we've combined our programming powers with skincare science to create a range of products tailored 
specifically for those who spend hours in front of screens. At GitGlow, we believe that taking care of your skin shouldn't be a 
hassle , it should be as seamless as writing code. With our refreshing serums, soothing masks, and cutting-edge solutions, you 
can code with confidence, knowing that your skin is in good hands. Join us in embracing the beauty of technology and discover
